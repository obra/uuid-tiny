Revision history for UUID-Tiny

1.02    xxxx-xx-xx, caugustin.de
        Cosmetic changes to documentation.
        Changed comments on Perl versions.
        Changed POD example code (there were some "-" in the names).
        "my" instead of "our" seed (no need to be a public global var).
        Introducing UUID_TIME etc. as alternatives to UUID_V1 etc.
        New standard interface added ("use UUID::Tiny ':std';").
        Tries to load alternative SHA-1 modules, UUID_SHA1_AVAIL added.

1.01    2009-07-12, caugustin.de
        Synopsis corrected after CPAN upload of version 1.00.
        Explicit use of Digest::MD5 and Digest::SHA1 after related failures on
        CPAN Testers (let's see if it will help ...).
        Modified clk_seq algorithm (simplified, independent of node_id).

1.00    2009-06-21, caugustin.de
        First, feature-complete and tested version.
