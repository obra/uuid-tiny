Revision history for UUID-Tiny

1.02    2009-08-21, caugustin.de
        Cosmetic changes to documentation.
        Changed comments on Perl versions.
        Changed POD example code (there were some "-" in the names).
        "my" instead of "our" seed (no need to be a public global var).
        Introducing UUID_TIME etc. as alternatives to UUID_V1 etc.
        New standard interface added ("use UUID::Tiny ':std';").
        Tries to load alternative SHA-1 modules, UUID_SHA1_AVAIL added.
        Refactoring by Jesse Vincent.
        Testing the legacy interface.
        New _init_globals() to make UUID::Tiny "fork-safe".
        Test cases to prove "fork-safety" of v1 u. v4 UUIDs.
        Locking for thread-safety of MD5_CALCULATOR and SHA1_CALCULATOR.

1.01    2009-07-12, caugustin.de
        Synopsis corrected after CPAN upload of version 1.00.
        Explicit use of Digest::MD5 and Digest::SHA1 after related failures on
        CPAN Testers (let's see if it will help ...).
        Modified clk_seq algorithm (simplified, independent of node_id).

1.00    2009-06-21, caugustin.de
        First, feature-complete and tested version.
